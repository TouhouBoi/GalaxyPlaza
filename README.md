# Galaxy Plaza
A Miiverse clone experience created by Trinity and using Miiverse World and Project ULTIMA as a base, that allows you to create posts, communities and more with your friends and followers.
## What is this?
It's a Miiverse clone, except you can make posts outside of communities and a feed system is implemented showing you the latest posts from people you follow and communities you've favorited. It also includes helpful pages like a user/community discovery helper, new features like tagging and private communities and the most complex search system of any Miiverse clone. This is also the 2nd (1st being grape) open source PHP Miiverse clone to have messaging.
